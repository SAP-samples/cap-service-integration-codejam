# Set up a temporary localhost redirector

Follow the instructions in this document if you are working through [exercise 01](exercises/01-set-up-workspace/) and have decided to use a Dev Space in the SAP Business Application Studio as your working environment.

> This is a completely optional step, to allow you to follow `http://localhost:4004` style links in this CodeJam material, even if your CAP server is not actually available at that location.

## Install the Redirector extension

ðŸ‘‰ Head over to the [Redirector extension in the Chrome Web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd?hl=en) and select "Add to Chrome".

## Work out what your Dev Space port availability URLs look like

ðŸ‘‰ In your new Dev Space, open a new terminal and run a simple test HTTP server on port 4004 to trigger the SAP Business Application Studio's port forwarding infrastructure, so you can open a new browser tab to see what the URL looks like for your Dev Space:

```bash
python3 -mhttp.server 4004
```

This should produce a log line like this:

```text
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4004 (http://0.0.0.0:4004/) ...
```

More importantly, you should also then see a popup that looks like this:

![Port 4004 available](./exercises/02-explore-basic-service/assets/port-available-bas.png)

Choose "Open in a New Tab" and take a note of the URL, which should look something like this, with differences in the workspace ID (it's `sd4hv` here) and possibly the region too (which is `us10` here):

```text
https://port4004-workspaces-ws-sd4hv.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/
```

> In case you're wondering what's being served, it's a simple listing of the contents of the directory where the Python HTTP server is running.

## Create a rule in the Redirector

ðŸ‘‰ Open the Redirector configuration, which should look something like this:

![Redirector configuration](./assets/redirector-configuration.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Create a new redirect entry, filling in the fields as follows:

|Field|Value|
|-|-|
|Description|SAP CodeJam on CAP Service Integration|
|Example URL|`http://localhost:4004`|
|Include Pattern|`http://localhost:(4004\|4005).*`|
|Redirect To|`https://port$1-workspaces-ws-xxxxx.yyyy.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap` <br>where `xxxxx` and `yyyy` are specific to your URLs that you see|
|Pattern type|Regular Expression|
|Pattern Description|Localhost to Dev Space service|

ðŸ‘‰ Save the redirect once you've completed the entries.

ðŸ‘‰ Now, to test, try selecting this link: <http://localhost:4004>. If the redirect entry has been configured successfully, you should be taken to the corresponding URL served from your Dev Space, and see the directory listing as before.

That's it!

## Removing the rule and / or extension

Once the CodeJam is over, you can remove the rule or even the entire extension; it's only there to make it easier for you to follow `localhost` URLs in the material and be taken to the right location served up by your specific Dev Space.
