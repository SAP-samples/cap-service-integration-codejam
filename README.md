# Service integration with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-service-integration-codejam)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-service-integration-codejam)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the "Service Consumption with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model" CodeJam, brought to you by the Developer Advocates at SAP.

## Overview

This CodeJam introduces attendees to service integration with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). Specifically, the Node.js flavor of CAP is used.

## About this CodeJam

During this CodeJam, you'll become acquainted with how external services can be integrated and consumed from within a CAP project. You'll also understand about how event-based data federation can work. In working through this CodeJam you'll also become familiar with how the SAP Cloud SDK covers connectivity and destinations, supporting such integration scenarios with CAP.

## Session prerequisites

In order to get the most from this CodeJam, and to be able to work through the exercises, there are certain prerequisites that you must have sorted out before the day of the CodeJam.

The prerequisites are detailed in a separate [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file. Please ensure you have everything ready before attending the CodeJam.

## Exercises

These are the exercises, each in their own directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the "coordinated" approach:

The instructor will set you off on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do; if you finish before others, there are some questions at the end of the exercise for you to ponder. Do not proceed to the next exercise until the instructor tells you to do so.

> The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this ðŸ‘‰ throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).
