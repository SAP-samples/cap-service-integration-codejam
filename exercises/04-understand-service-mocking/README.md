# Exercise 04 - Understand service mocking

At the end of this exercise you'll understand the difference between `cds watch` and `cds run`, and have learned how, during development, the CAP SDK can provide service mocking for rapid & comfortable development cycles.

At this point, going into this exercise, you've imported the EDMX definition for the external `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` service, and have a new directory `srv/external/` containing the original EDMX file and a CSN equivalent. Other than that, your basic service definition (at the persistence and service layers) is still the same.

## Start the CAP server

During the previous exercise you stopped the CAP server.

ðŸ‘‰ Start things up again, but using `cds run`:

```bash
cds run
```

This should produce log output that looks like this:

```text
[cds] - loaded model from 5 file(s):

  srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn
  app/fiori.cds
  srv/incidents-service.cds
  db/schema.cds

  > init from db/data/acme.incmgt-Appointments.csv
/> successfully deployed to in-memory database.

[cds] - using auth strategy { kind: 'mocked', impl: 'node_modules/@sap/cds/lib/auth/basic-auth' }

[cds] - serving IncidentsService { path: '/odata/v4/incidents', impl: 'srv/incidents-service.js' }

[cds] - server listening on { url: 'http://localhost:4004' }
[cds] - launched at 1/29/2024, 9:36:59 AM, version: 7.5.3, in: 2.254s
[cds] - [ terminate with ^C ]
```

ðŸ‘‰ Head over to <http://localhost:4004> and see what you get. It's no different than what you saw [at the end of exercise 02](../02-explore-basic-service/README.md#run-the-service):

![basic service](assets/basic-service.png)

This shouldn't be too surprising, as `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` is defined as an external service, one that this service will primarily consume, rather than make available. The only clue that this external service is even acknowledged is in the list of files that are loaded, at the start of the log output, which now includes `srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn`:

```text
[cds] - loaded model from 5 file(s):

  srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn
  app/fiori.cds
  srv/incidents-service.cds
  db/schema.cds
  node_modules/@sap/cds/common.cds
```

> See the link in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section to the blog post on FP, function chains and CAP model loading to find out exactly how and why `srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn` is even included.

ðŸ‘‰ For now, stop the server again with Ctrl-C.

## Take a naÃ¯ve approach to incorporating the external service

Let's try an experiment. Just for a moment, let's take a naÃ¯ve approach to bringing this external service into our own basic service, without thinking too much about it. How might that look?

ðŸ‘‰ Extend the `srv/incidents-service.cds` file as follows:

* add a `using` statement as recommended in the log output [in the previous exercise when you imported the API specification](../03-import-odata-api/README.md#import-the-api-specification)
* add a new entity `Customers` to the `IncidentsService` service definition, as a projection on the `A_BusinessPartner` entity set in the external service

It should end up looking like this (concentrate here as you'll be undoing this addition shortly):

```cds
using { acme.incmgt } from '../db/schema';
using { API_BUSINESS_PARTNER as external } from './external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER';

service IncidentsService {
    entity Customers      as projection on external.A_BusinessPartner;
    entity Incidents      as projection on incmgt.Incidents;
    entity Appointments   as projection on incmgt.Appointments;
    entity ServiceWorkers as projection on incmgt.ServiceWorkers;
}
```

While you do this (and assuming you're typing it in manually, like a good participant!) notice how the CDS language support in your editor makes it very easy to explore the resources with keyboard completion, as it knows how to read and present the definitions in the recently imported external service:

![completion of resources from the external service](assets/external-completion.png)

ðŸ‘‰ At the command line, restart the server (you should have stopped it earlier in this exercise with Ctrl-C) by invoking `cds run` again:

```bash
cds run
```

This should produce log output similar to what you saw just before - no discernible difference.

ðŸ‘‰ Now head on over to <http://localhost:4004> and note that the Customers entity that you added is now showing up in the list of service endpoints, great!

![customers endpoint](assets/customers-endpoint.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Select that `Customers` endpoint link <http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/incidents/Customers> (not the Fiori preview one). What do you get?

```xml
<error xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/metadata">
<code>501</code>
<message>Entity "IncidentsService.Customers" is annotated with "@cds.persistence.skip" and cannot be served generically.</message>
</error>
```

Hmm.

Indeed, checking in `srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn` shows us that this is the truth (you can verify this yourself in the file):

```json
"API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartner": {
  "kind": "entity",
  "@cds.external": true,
  "@cds.persistence.skip": true,
  "@sap.deletable": "false",
  "@sap.content.version": "1",
  "@sap.label": "Business Partner",
  "elements": { ... }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Before we carry on thinking about this for a minute, terminate the current `cds run` process with Ctrl-C.

This is because external service definitions, such as CSN files that are generated during the import of an API definition (like we have here), can be used as any other CDS definition, but they don't get translated into database tables and views unless they are mocked.

This is reflected in the use of the `@cds.persistence.skip` annotation, which tells the compiler that the entity shall not exist in the database at all (see the reference to CDS persistence annotations in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section at the end of this exercise).

This makes sense, as we're dealing here with an external, independent service.

> If you're curious about where exactly in the JSON-based `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn` file this annotation is represented, and want to find out mechanically rather than look through it yourself, you could of course embrace jq and use a short expression to get right to it:
> ```jq
> .definitions
> | to_entries
> | map(select(.key|endswith(".A_BusinessPartner")))
> | first.value
> | with_entries(select(.key|startswith("@")))
> ```
> Here's an example of running this (in one line) against the file:
> ```shell
> jq '.definitions|to_entries|map(select(.key|endswith(".A_BusinessPartner")))|first.value|with_entries(select(.key|startswith("@")))' srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn
> ```
> And here's what it should produce:
> ```json
> {
>   "@cds.external": true,
>   "@cds.persistence.skip": true,
>   "@sap.deletable": "false",
>   "@sap.content.version": "1",
>   "@sap.label": "Business Partner"
> }
> ```
> jq's trio of functions `to_entries`, `from_entries` and `with_entries` provide a powerful way to convert to and from dynamic and static (predictable) keys and values in objects.

Ultimately, we experienced this issue because we (deliberately) used `cds run`.

## Introduce mocking

We used `cds run` to illustrate the issue, or rather the distinction between local and remote services, and the serving thereof. What happens when you use `cds watch` instead of `cds run` here?

ðŸ‘‰ Without changing anything in `srv/incidents-service.cds`, execute `cds watch`:

```bash
cds watch
```

ðŸ‘‰ Examine the log output, which should now look something like this:

```text

cds serve all --with-mocks --in-memory?
live reload enabled for browsers

[cds] - [ terminate with ^C ]

```

It looks very similar to the output we've just seen from `cds run`, but there are a few essential additions.

## Understand what is happening with mocking

ðŸ‘‰ First, take a look at this part:

```text
cds serve all --with-mocks --in-memory?
live reload enabled for browsers
```

Most of us may already know about the [mind-bogglingly useful](https://www.clivebanks.co.uk/THHGTTG/THHGTTGradio1.htm#:~:text=mind%2Dbogglingly%20useful) monitor-and-live-reload feature of `cds watch`, but might not have paid much attention until now to what `cds watch` is really executing for us (in addition to running the file monitor), which is this:

```bash
cds serve all --with-mocks --in-memory?
```

> On a related note, `cds run` is short for `cds serve all`, but without the `--with-mocks` and `--in-memory?` options. Think of `cds watch` as something that's only relevant for development, not production.

Here's the help text for the `--with-mocks` option for `cds serve`:

```text
Use this in combination with the variants serving multiple services.
It starts in-process mock services for all required services configured
in package.json#cds.requires, which don't have external bindings
in the current process environment.
Note that by default, this feature is disabled in production and must be
enabled with configuration 'features.mocked_bindings=true'.
```

It's that second sentence that is key for us here. Our imported `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` service is a required service, in `package.json#cds.requires`. We saw that in the previous exercise when we [imported the API specification](../03-import-odata-api/README.md#import-the-api-specification). It's a required service - but we don't have an external binding for it. So via `--with-mocks`, it will be mocked for us.

> What is an "external binding"? Put simply, it is a set of related properties containing information on how and where to connect to a remote (i.e. "external") endpoint.

This automatic mocking is thus reflected in another difference in the log output of our invocation of `cds watch`, where we see this additional line:

```text
[cds] - mocking API_BUSINESS_PARTNER { path: '/odata/v4/api-business-partner' }
```

This shows us that the external service is being mocked, and being made available under a separate path in the service. That path is `/odata/v4/api-business-partner`.

ðŸ‘‰ Head on over to <http://localhost:4004> to see what is being served in the context of `cds watch` now. You should see something like this (just the first part is shown in this screenshot, there are more entities in the list):

![the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER service endpoint](assets/api-business-partner-service-endpoint.png)

This is a separate, second service endpoint that's now being served, at `/odata/v4/api-business-partner`, in addition to the `/odata/v4/incidents` service endpoint, which is listed further down.

ðŸ‘‰ Try this mocking out for yourself, by selecting the `A_BusinessPartner` entity, i.e. <http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/api-business-partner/A_BusinessPartner>.

You should be presented with something like this:

```text
{
  @odata.context: "$metadata#A_BusinessPartner",
  value: [ ],
}
```

It's not much, but it's better than an error, it's an actual valid response (check out the [Questions](#questions) section below for a couple of things to ponder on this output).

ðŸ‘‰ While you're there, head to the `/odata/v4/incidents` service endpoint and select the `Customers` link. The output should be similar, i.e. no error relating to persistence being skipped:

```text
{
  @odata.context: "$metadata#Customers",
  value: [ ],
}
```

> This (empty) data set, at <http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/incidents/Customers>, is actually the same source as <http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/api-business-partner/A_BusinessPartner>, except of course that the `@odata.context` tells us that semantically (from the data model perspective) the entity is different.

## Learn about the CDS services registry

There was another line in the output from `cds watch` that we don't see in the `cds run` equivalent. Did you spot it?

ðŸ‘‰ Head back to the output, and identify the line that looks like this:

```text
[cds] - connect using bindings from: { registry: '~/.cds-services.json' }
```

> Note from the filename that this is in your home directory (`~`) and is a hidden file (the name begins with a period). It should be clear from this that this is only for non-productive i.e. development use, in the context of `cds watch`.

This file contains sections for services provided, and services required, and is written to or read from when `cds watch` is invoked (for more information, see the link to the Automatic Binding documentation in the [Further reading](#further-reading) below).

ðŸ‘‰ Examine the contents of this file; at this point, you should see something like this (the `server` value will likely be different - it's a process ID):



```json
{
  "cds": {
    "provides": {
      "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
        "kind": "odata",
        "credentials": {
          "url": "http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/api-business-partner"
        },
        "server": 9037
      },
      "IncidentsService": {
        "kind": "odata",
        "credentials": {
          "url": "http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/incidents"
        },
        "server": 9037
      }
    },
    "servers": {
      "9037": {
        "root": "file:///home/user/projects/cap-service-integration-codejam/incidents",
        "url": "http://localhost:4004"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> You can select the file from the log output line (use Ctrl-Click or Cmd-Click) or use the menu option "Go -> Go to File..." (commonly known as the "File Selector"), often invoked with Ctrl-P or Cmd-P, and specify the name and location manually and directly, like this:
>
> ![go to file ~/.cds-services.json](assets/go-to-file.png)

In other words, the CAP server currently started is providing both the locally defined `IncidentsService` but is also providing, via mocking, the `API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` service too.

## Remove the temporary CDS definitions

Right now the service definition (in `srv/incidents-service.cds`) looks like this:

```cds
using { acme.incmgt } from '../db/schema';
using { API_BUSINESS_PARTNER as external } from './external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER';

service IncidentsService {
    entity Customers      as projection on external.A_BusinessPartner;
    entity Incidents      as projection on incmgt.Incidents;
    entity Appointments   as projection on incmgt.Appointments;
    entity ServiceWorkers as projection on incmgt.ServiceWorkers;
}
```

Before we finish this exercise, let's clean up, and remove those two lines we added earlier.

ðŸ‘‰ Remove the second `using` line, and the line defining a `Customers` entity as a projection on `external.A_BusinessPartner` so that the file contents revert to what they were before, like this:

```cds
using { acme.incmgt } from '../db/schema';

service IncidentsService {
    entity Incidents      as projection on incmgt.Incidents;
    entity Appointments   as projection on incmgt.Appointments;
    entity ServiceWorkers as projection on incmgt.ServiceWorkers;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Assuming your `cds watch` process is still running at this point, note what happens when these changes are saved and the CAP server restarts. 

Both service endpoints, i.e. `/odata/v4/api-business-partner` and `/odata/v4/incidents` are still available and being served (at <http://localhost:4004>), and the `/odata/v4/api-business-partner/A_BusinessPartner` resource still returns (an empty) entity set. You can see that this is due to the mocking, not to any of the modifications you'd made to this service layer CDS file.

However, you should also notice that the `Customers` resource in the `/incidents` service endpoint is now gone again.

ðŸ‘‰ Take a moment to think about the naÃ¯ve approach we took here to bring in an external service. While it's possible, it's rather too direct, and definitely not the cleanest and most modular approach. This is why we've removed this experiment now.

## Summary

At this point you have the service definition for the Business Partner (A2X) API from SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and have imported it into your CAP project, and now understand how you can have that external service mocked for you, in the same CAP server process as your local service.

## Questions

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. In the [Understand what is happening with mocking](#understand-what-is-happening-with-mocking) section, you got the following output; what is this, and what does it tell us?
    ```text
    {
      @odata.context: "$metadata#A_BusinessPartner",
      value: [ ],
    }
    ```
